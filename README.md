# FIR System on Blockchain

## Description:

 In this project we have to create a webpage where users can file their FIR reports to the Police and can use the app to track their FIR status. To implement t blockchain immutability into the system we will use SHA256 hashing algorithm. It will be very helpful in securing the system as the blockchain algorithm can prevent in evidence manipulation and allow for transparency in investigation.

## Features:

 - User Authentication – Users can create account, sign in and log out using a Firebase Authentication system.
 - FIR filling system – Users can file an official FIR report with personal details (date, time, location), category of crime  and  any photos and videos of evidence. 
 - Officers Dashboard – There will be a separate dashboard for the officers so that can view new FIRs, update investigation status, add any notes.
- Immutability Status– Each action and log entry will result in the generation of a hash that will prevent any evidence manipulation. 
- Public FIR verification – A public page will be present where citizens can check FIR ID, Hash and the system will check for any tempering attempts 
- MetaMask Authentication- For additional security a MetaMask verification can also be implemented. 
- Data analytics- Crime analytics for a particular region can be shown using charts and heatmaps to raise awareness.  
- Search feature-Users can search for easily search for reports in multiple police stations.
